/**
 *
 Given an integer array arr, return all the unique pairs [arr[i], arr[j]] such that i != j and arr[i] + arr[j] == 0.

    Note: The pairs must be returned in sorted order, the solution array should also be sorted, and the answer must not contain any duplicate pairs.

    Examples:

    Input: arr = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
    Output: [[-1, 1]]
    Explanation: arr[0] + arr[2] = (-1)+ 1 = 0.
    arr[2] + arr[4] = 1 + (-1) = 0.
    The distinct pair are [-1,1].
